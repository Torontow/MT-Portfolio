# Michael Torontow's Portflio

![Final Product] "https://torontow.github.io/MT-Portfolio.github.io/"

## The Project

The client requested a Portfolio site with a quick biography, a few photos from his career, and a contact page. 

Given that he is an actor and many casting directors these days do their job while on the go, it is important that the entire site be responsive for mobile viewing. The page was intended to be simple in style and appearance. 

### The Process

I knew I would be using Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/), so I began by simply coding 'shell' pages for the index, the contact, and the portfolio of photos. While doing so, I essentially wrote a shopping list of things to search for on Bootstrap, which I wound up using (with adaptations, of course) for the navbar, grid layouts, and images. Once I was happy with the bones of the project, I validated all the HTML before adding some supplemental CSS of my own.

Now, it was initially expected, I believe, that the site would have a simple colour scheme of a grey, patterned background with some sea-foam green and grey highlights, but it reminded me too much of my bedroom when I was an 11-year-old, so I decided to go out on a limb and add styling that more closely matched the client's personality. Since all of my personal touches exist in the external CSS file, it can easily be easily changed.
