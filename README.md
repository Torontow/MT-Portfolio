## Description

This is my official web dev portfolio page.

Using Bootstraps facility for creating responsive sites, I made this readable on all types of devices. It features a few of my best achievements in web design, and also links to my actor website since people searching for me may not get to where they think they ought to be!

There are no included tests for this project. Given that this was my first time working with handlebars.js, I started by creating an index.html to design the view of the site, which I then translated over to the various handlebars files and partials.
